# Secure Messaging Repository

Project presented in the Security course (Universidade de Aveiro), 2017.

The main goal is to implement a secure messaging repository system, in python.
THe system has to assure:
* Message confidentiality, integrity and authentication
* Message delivery confirmation
* Identity preservation

The personal identification is made with recourse to the Portuguese Citizenship Card, with the public keys in the card and the validation of the certificate chain.
The exchanged messages are ciphered with created public keys, in combination with other criptographic techniques.
